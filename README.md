# MCMC-Stochastic-Volatility
This code uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo to estimate the parameters in the Heston model and price European Call options on AAPL stock.

The code is based on a project by Sergey Nasekin titled Jump-Diffusion-Calibrator. Sergey Naeskins code is based on a paper titled "Estimating Heston's and Batesâ€™ models parameters using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation" by Cape et al.

There are some adjustments to the code by Sergey Nasekin, such as adding an option pricing feature, determining the accuracy of the parameter estimations, and updating the data used.
