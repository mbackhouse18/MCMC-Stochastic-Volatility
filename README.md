# MCMC-Stochastic-Volatility
This code uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo to estimate the parameters in the Heston model, price European Call options on AAPL stock, and produce a graph of the estimated stock price paths and volatility paths.

The following code is based on code by Sergey Nasekin titled Jump-Diffusion-Calibrator. This code is based on a paper titled "Estimating Heston's and Batesâ€™ models parameters using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation" by Cape et al.

There are some adjustments to the code by Sergey Nasekin, such as adding an option pricing feature, determining the accuracy of the parameter estimations, and updating the data used.
